                <span class="testimonialtext">My son was one angry gamer. That's for sure! I lived in daily fear of my angry gamer son. I would do everything I could for him, clean his room, wash his clothes, and make him food. Nothing seemed to get through to him. He would sit at his computer all day and screm "MOMMY GIVE ME TENDIES" when he was hungry. I would bring him chicken fingers and it wasn't enough to make him happy. He would slap the plate out of my hands and yell "NO HONEY MUSSY? MOM DIFF! MOM DIFF!" I reached out to Clinical Gamer and they reccomended their lobotomy service to me. I was nervous at first, but after a successful operation, my son is very docile and obedient now. Thanks Clinical Gamer!</span>
